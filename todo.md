To Do before next update:

1. Remove transparency from tabs.
2. Fix meta table - convert to a flex object (grid?).
3. Upgrade pic search to match article search. Adaptive meta box based on image width.

Longer-term changes:

4. Deploy powershell script to pull site from github.
5. Fix picture caption size in article preview - needs better XSLT to mark the headlines differently. Or first-child css rule to tell them apart.
7. Uploading. Dropzone.
8. Author suggestor
9. Bricklayer view for images
10. Adaptive search form. use z-index to hide additional criteria? + to add criteria, slides out to allow user to add a criteria.
11. Find a way to subtly boost newer results when there are many results.

Use flex-flow for picture gallery?
display: flex on container
