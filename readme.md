# Web portal to Media24's ElasticSearch archive.

This is is designed to give people access the Media24's ElasticSearch archive without needing the desktop software to be installed. It shows 4 different panes for 4 types of content: images, stories (XML files from EidosMedia Method√©), PDFs (printed pages) and HTML files - which are mostly maps of page layouts but also sometimes older archived web stories.

I am still working on the search form. The features to specify a date range and a publication are not yet working.
